# KryptoJobs2Go


KryptoJobs2Go is an application that customers can use to find fintech professionals from among a list of candidates, hire them, and pay them with cryptocurrency using the Ethereum blockchain network.

## How it works

The following steps were carried out:

* Generate a new Ethereum account instance by using the mnemonic seed phrase provided by Ganache.

* Fetch and display the account balance associated with your Ethereum account address.

* Calculate the total value of an Ethereum transaction, including the gas estimate, that pays a KryptoJobs2Go candidate for their work.

* Digitally sign a transaction that pays a KryptoJobs2Go candidate, and send this transaction to the Ganache blockchain.

* Review the transaction hash code associated with the validated blockchain transaction.
